## Discussion log 31/10/18
- Decided to create a ~20 x ~30 grid of LEDs, with each LED having a width/height of ~3.33 cm. After cost and size considerations, resized to 16 x 32 LEDs, at 30 LEDs / m.
- Decided to prioritize programming Tetris over pong and images/gifs. Method of playing Tetris (app/website/physical controller) still undecided.
- Decided to have few or no meetings in December based on limited availability of 3-4 people a week.
- Decided to organize optional teaching sessions related to this project next semester due to strong interest. Topics include:
    - Basic computer graphics and colour theory
    - Web programming on the ESP8266
    - WS2812B LED strip in-depth
